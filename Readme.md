# A cool modpack

Go into `AutoModpack\modpack\config\builtinservers.json` and put your IP address/DNS there or just remove the mod (and config file) entirely.

The `server side only` and `server+client` mods are on the folder `mods\`

The `client side only` and `client+server` mods are on the folder `AutoModpack\modpack\mods\`

Install the modpack using [ATLauncher Portable](https://atlauncher.com/downloads). Steps [here](https://imgur.com/a/pYzFW5a).

Give `AutoClient\TO SEND\ATLauncher.1.0.zip` to your clients. `AutoClient` is just a folder I created. Not linked to anything. `AutoModpack` is a mod. It is not compatible with [Essential](https://essential.gg/).

Also GitHub is so shit I had to delete `AutoModpack\modpack.zip` so the server will have to regenerate it before ANY client joins. Or the client does the request to the server so he generates it, I have no idea and I don't care.
